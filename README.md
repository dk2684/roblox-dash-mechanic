### Roblox - Robust Dashing Mechanic
*Requires Roblox Studio and knowledge of its API*

Designed to be used as a backbone to any dashing or linear movement mechanic.\
The dashing distance is guaranteed to match the inputted distance and is unaffected by friction (e.g. air vs ground). Force on the Humanoid is applied through BodyPosition and directional dashing is achieved by monitoring keystrokes every frame through RenderStepped.\
The usage is very simple and supports all platforms (computer, phone, tablet, console).
